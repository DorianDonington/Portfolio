The code has to be executed sequentially from the top to the bottom. It creates, from the movie_metadata, four CSV's:
    A movie attributes CSV and an actor attributes CSV
    A movie-movie-edges CSV that matches two movies if they have either the same director or two common actors
    An actor-actor-edgesCSV that matches two actors if they worked in the same film

The report includes the graphs created from these CSV, and the conclusions we can extract from the data.
