Implementing the PageRank algorithm.

The code has to be executed sequentally from the top to the bottom. It creates, from the Data files, a list of sites based 
on a number of factors which are explained in the report. Each list takes a while to generate! (30 secs - 1 min)
   
The report includes the lists, and our conclusions about each one of them.
